1. Begin with training dataset, which should have some feature variables and classification or regression output.
2. Determine the best faeture in the dataset to split the data on; more on how we define feature later.
3. Split the data into subsets that contain the correct values for this best feature. This splitting basically 
defines a node on the tree i.e node is a splitting point based on a certain feature from our data.

4. Recursively generate new tree nodes by using the subset of data created from step3.
